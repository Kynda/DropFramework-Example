# Drop Framework Example

This repository can be used as a starting point for developing an application
using the [Drop Micro-Framework](https://github.com/Kynda/DropFramework) by [Joe
Hallenbeck](http://joehallenbeck.com).

Namely: This project loads the DropFramework and provides all the necessary
configuration options in the locations that the framework expects. Furthermore,
it demonstrates a simple controller interacting with a service model and domain
model to load a series of blog posts from a database and display them as a
complete HTML document.

For more information see the the link to the main framework repository.
